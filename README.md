# Graph Calculator

This repository is my implementation of Assignment 3 in the course SOFTENG 281: Object-Oriented Programming at the University of Auckland in Semester One 2023.
The primary learning objective of this assignment was to understand the properties of the graph data structure and implement simpler data structures (linked list, doubly linked list, stack, and queue).
Considering the time complexity of the functions within the data structures was necessary.

Javadoc comments were used for documentation.

My code is located in the [src/main/java/nz/ac/auckland/se281/datastructures](src/main/java/nz/ac/auckland/se281/datastructures) folder.


### Functionality

The command line graph calculator can:
- List the set of root vertices
- Check whether the graph is reflexive
- Check whether the graph is symmetric
- Check whether the graph is transitive
- Check whether the graph is antisymmetric
- Check whether the graph is an equivalence relation
- Compute the equivalence class for a specified vertex in the graph
- Perform an iterative breadth-first search on the graph
- Perform an iterative depth-first search on the graph
- Perform a recursive breadth-first search on the graph
- Perform a recursive depth-first search on the graph


### Marking

The marking scheme included marks for functionality, object-oriented design, and code style. This achieved 100% for all sections.
